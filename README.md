# KeyHunt - BSGS Search [RUS](README_ru.md)

KeyHunt is a high-performance tool for searching Bitcoin private keys using the Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS) algorithm. This version includes significant optimizations for modern processors, improved memory management, and flexible search settings.

## Key Features and Changes
- **Higher speed**: Compared to the original Keyhunt, the speed is 20-40% faster for BSGS, with faster Bloom filter creation and faster Bloom filter loading.
- **BSGS Algorithm**: Efficient implementation of the algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem.
- **Bloom Filters**: Uses memory-efficient Bloom filters to store precomputed tables.
- **Parallel Processing**: 
  - **Parallel Bloom Filter Loading**: Filters are loaded in parallel across multiple threads, drastically reducing startup time.
  - **Multithreading**: Uses all available CPU cores for search by default.
- **Optimized Hashing**: 
  - Switch to **XXH64** for Bloom filter checksums and internal hashing, replacing slower functions.
  - File checksums are now verified via XXH64.
- **Search Flexibility**:
  - **WIF Mask**: Search for private keys matching a specific WIF pattern (`-w` flag).
  - **Custom Ranges**: Ability to specify specific hexadecimal (HEX) search ranges.
  - **Progress Saving**: Progress is automatically saved to `checked-deep.txt` when using `-D` mode, allowing you to resume search from where it was interrupted.
- **Console Output**: Optional output of WIF keys to the console (`-wif 1`).
- **File Organization**: Bloom filters are now saved in a separate `filters/` folder with organized names.

## What's added:
1.0.4
What's added:
Corrected the -wif (1 | 0) output for WIF output
Fixed the skipping error
Fixed the filter generation for Windows
Accelerated bloom using 64-bit mix
Accelerated bloom generation
Accelerated AVX2 mathematics
Vectorized Bloom, FUSE, XOR filter checking
Prefetching for XOR Fuse (Filter acceleration)
Huge Pages (Filter acceleration)
Assembler for the double function
Added a blocked filter -x blocked (speed is slow like Bloom, but the size is more compact, not recommended. Currently, FUSE is the best)
FUSE acceleration by 25 cycles

Attention: You must recreate the filters, as they are not compatible with the old version.

1.0.3
Deleted oldbloom.
Added saving the progress file once per minute (file save.txt).

Added XOR and Fuse Filters. Selected via -x (bloom|xor|fuse).

XOR FUSE filter optimization + 10 percent. Stage 1, 2, 3.

Added checked-deep.txt check. If the traversed ranges from the -D deep.txt file are in the checked-deep.txt file, then it does not check them.

Added cleaning of the tmp folder before and after creating the FUSE and XOR filter.


Attention: Be sure to recreate the filters, as they do not work from the old version.

## Usage

## Disclaimer
I created this tool as a universal tool for solving puzzles. I recommend everyone to use it ONLY for solving puzzles.

Some users asked me to add support for Ethereum and mini-keys, and I did. But again, I recommend using this program ONLY for solving puzzles.

## Download and Build
This program was developed in a Linux environment. If you are using Windows, I highly recommend using the WSL environment in Windows. It is available in the Microsoft Store.

Please install it on your system.
```bash
git
build-essential
libssl-dev
libgmp-dev
```

On Ubuntu-based systems, run the following commands to update your current environment and install the tools needed for compilation.

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install git -y
apt install build-essential -y
apt install libssl-dev -y
apt install libgmp-dev -y
```

To clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slait/Keyhuntbsgs.git
```

Don't forget to navigate to the keyhunt directory (but I'm not here to teach you Linux commands).

```bash
cd keyhunt
```

### Build
Use `Makefile` to compile. You can specify the target architecture for optimization:
```bash
# Auto-detect architecture (recommended)
make

# Explicit architecture specification (e.g., for AMD EPYC 9654)
make ARCH=znver4
```
Supported architectures: `native` (default)
```
# AMD:
   znver4        - AMD EPYC 9654, Ryzen 7000 series
   znver3        - Ryzen 5000 series
   znver2        - Ryzen 3000 series

# Intel:
   arrowlake     - Intel Core Ultra 200 series (e.g. 265KF) (Requires GCC 14+)
   raptorlake    - Intel 13th Gen & 14th Gen (Core i9-13900K, i9-14900K) (Requires GCC 13+)
   alderlake     - Intel 12th Gen (Core i9-12900K)
   skylake       - Older Intel CPUs

# Generic:
   native        - Auto-detect host CPU (Best for local compilation)
   x86-64-v3     - Generic modern CPUs (AVX2)
   x86-64-v4     - Generic very modern CPUs (AVX512)
```

### Normal BSGS Search
Run a standard BSGS search in the default range or random start.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -t 8 -f test.txt -S -s 10
```
* `-m bsgs`: Set BSGS mode.
* `-t 8`: Use 8 threads (if omitted, uses all cores).
* `-f test.txt`: File containing public keys to search for.
* `-S`: Save bloom filter to `filters` folder.
* `-s 10`: Output search info, speed, and time every 10 seconds to console. If `-s 0` is specified, output is hidden. Any number of seconds can be specified.


### WIF Output
Enable printing found WIF keys to the console (default is off/0).
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -f test.txt -S -s 10 -wif 1
```
* `-wif 1`: Print WIF key information to the string.

### WIF Mask Search
Search for a private key that matches a partial WIF string (mask). This generates a `deep.txt` file with ranges and processes them.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -w KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH_LrciVrZi_qYwk________________

Warning, offset is not implemented yet. Suitable for searching for the last characters or unknowns. The program creates a deep.txt file with ranges and processes them.
```
* `-w <mask_pattern>`: Specify WIF pattern.

### Custom Range
Search within a specific hexadecimal range `Start:End`.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -r 20000000000000000:3ffffffffffffffff -f test.txt -S -s 10
```
* `-r 20000000000000000:3ffffffffffffffff`: You can specify the search range manually.

### Continue Search (Deep Mode)
Use `-D` to process ranges from a file (default `deep.txt` or created by `-w` flag). Progress is tracked in `checked-deep.txt`.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -D deep.txt
```
* `-D deep.txt`: You can specify multiple ranges in the `deep.txt` file; after checking a range, the program automatically moves to the next one and saves the completed range to `checked-deep.txt`.


### Filter Generation and Storage
Bloom filters are generated automatically if they do not exist. They are saved in the `filters/` directory if you specify the `-S` key, to avoid cluttering the working folder.
**File Names**: Filter files are named sequentially (`keyhunt_bsgs_1...`, `_2`, etc.) for better order.

**Note**: Loading time is significantly improved due to parallelization.

## Command Line Arguments

| Flag         | Description                                                                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-m bsgs`    | **Required**. Sets BSGS mode.                                                     |

| `-r <s:e>`   | Set search range (HEX format start:end).                                          |
| `-D <file>`  | Run in "Deep" mode using a range file (e.g., `deep.txt`).                         |

| `-x <val>`   | Choose the bloom, xor, or fuse filter (I recommend fuse).                         |
|              | This requires a lot of RAM and creation time.                                     |
| `-S`         | Saving the filter. Large S. I recommend using this always.                        |
| `-s <n>`     | Output detailed information in seconds. Lowercase 's'. I recommend 1 and 30.      |

Attention: You must recreate the filters, as the old ones are not compatible with this version.
