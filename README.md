# KeyHunt - BSGS Search

KeyHunt is a high-performance tool for searching Bitcoin private keys using the Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS) algorithm. This version includes significant optimizations for modern processors, improved memory management, and flexible search settings.

## Key Features and Changes
- **Higher speed**: Compared to the original Keyhunt, the speed is 20-40% faster for BSGS, with faster Bloom filter creation and faster Bloom filter loading.
- **BSGS Algorithm**: Efficient implementation of the algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem.
- **Bloom Filters**: Uses memory-efficient Bloom filters to store precomputed tables.
- **Parallel Processing**: 
  - **Parallel Bloom Filter Loading**: Filters are loaded in parallel across multiple threads, drastically reducing startup time.
  - **Multithreading**: Uses all available CPU cores for search by default.
- **Optimized Hashing**: 
  - Switch to **XXH64** for Bloom filter checksums and internal hashing, replacing slower functions.
  - File checksums are now verified via XXH64.
- **Search Flexibility**:
  - **WIF Mask**: Search for private keys matching a specific WIF pattern (`-w` flag).
  - **Custom Ranges**: Ability to specify specific hexadecimal (HEX) search ranges.
  - **Progress Saving**: Progress is automatically saved to `checked-deep.txt` when using `-D` mode, allowing you to resume search from where it was interrupted.
- **Console Output**: Optional output of WIF keys to the console (`-wif 1`).
- **File Organization**: Bloom filters are now saved in a separate `filters/` folder with organized names.

## Usage

## Disclaimer
I created this tool as a universal tool for solving puzzles. I recommend everyone to use it ONLY for solving puzzles.

Some users asked me to add support for Ethereum and mini-keys, and I did. But again, I recommend using this program ONLY for solving puzzles.

## Download and Build
This program was developed in a Linux environment. If you are using Windows, I highly recommend using the WSL environment in Windows. It is available in the Microsoft Store.

Please install it on your system.
```bash
git
build-essential
libssl-dev
libgmp-dev
```

On Ubuntu-based systems, run the following commands to update your current environment and install the tools needed for compilation.

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install git -y
apt install build-essential -y
apt install libssl-dev -y
apt install libgmp-dev -y
```

To clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slait/Keyhuntbsgs.git
```

Don't forget to navigate to the keyhunt directory (but I'm not here to teach you Linux commands).

```bash
cd keyhunt
```

### Build
Use `Makefile` to compile. You can specify the target architecture for optimization:
```bash
# Auto-detect architecture (recommended)
make

# Explicit architecture specification (e.g., for AMD EPYC 9654)
make ARCH=znver4
```
Supported architectures: `native` (default)
```
# AMD:
   znver4        - AMD EPYC 9654, Ryzen 7000 series
   znver3        - Ryzen 5000 series
   znver2        - Ryzen 3000 series

# Intel:
   arrowlake     - Intel Core Ultra 200 series (e.g. 265KF) (Requires GCC 14+)
   raptorlake    - Intel 13th Gen & 14th Gen (Core i9-13900K, i9-14900K) (Requires GCC 13+)
   alderlake     - Intel 12th Gen (Core i9-12900K)
   skylake       - Older Intel CPUs

# Generic:
   native        - Auto-detect host CPU (Best for local compilation)
   x86-64-v3     - Generic modern CPUs (AVX2)
   x86-64-v4     - Generic very modern CPUs (AVX512)
```

### Normal BSGS Search
Run a standard BSGS search in the default range or random start.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -t 8 -f test.txt -S -s 10
```
* `-m bsgs`: Set BSGS mode.
* `-t 8`: Use 8 threads (if omitted, uses all cores).
* `-f test.txt`: File containing public keys to search for.
* `-S`: Save bloom filter to `filters` folder.
* `-s 10`: Output search info, speed, and time every 10 seconds to console. If `-s 0` is specified, output is hidden. Any number of seconds can be specified.


### WIF Output
Enable printing found WIF keys to the console (default is off/0).
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -f test.txt -S -s 10 -wif 1
```
* `-wif 1`: Print WIF key information to the string.

### WIF Mask Search
Search for a private key that matches a partial WIF string (mask). This generates a `deep.txt` file with ranges and processes them.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -w KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH_LrciVrZi_qYwk________________

Warning, offset is not implemented yet. Suitable for searching for the last characters or unknowns. The program creates a deep.txt file with ranges and processes them.
```
* `-w <mask_pattern>`: Specify WIF pattern.

### Custom Range
Search within a specific hexadecimal range `Start:End`.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -r 20000000000000000:3ffffffffffffffff -f test.txt -S -s 10
```
* `-r 20000000000000000:3ffffffffffffffff`: You can specify the search range manually.

### Continue Search (Deep Mode)
Use `-D` to process ranges from a file (default `deep.txt` or created by `-w` flag). Progress is tracked in `checked-deep.txt`.
```bash
./keyhunt -m bsgs -D deep.txt
```
* `-D deep.txt`: You can specify multiple ranges in the `deep.txt` file; after checking a range, the program automatically moves to the next one and saves the completed range to `checked-deep.txt`.


### Filter Generation and Storage
Bloom filters are generated automatically if they do not exist. They are saved in the `filters/` directory if you specify the `-S` key, to avoid cluttering the working folder.
**File Names**: Filter files are named sequentially (`keyhunt_bsgs_1...`, `_2`, etc.) for better order.

**Note**: Loading time is significantly improved due to parallelization.
